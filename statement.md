# Problem Statement

## The Problem
Beginner programmers and finance students often lack a practical understanding of how digital banking ledgers work. This project aims to bridge that gap by simulating the backend logic of a bank.

## Scope
The project covers the lifecycle of a user bank account: from creation to daily transactions. It does not cover inter-bank transfers or currency conversion.

## Target Users
- Students learning financial logic.
- Individuals wanting a simple, offline way to track a virtual budget.

## High-Level Features
1. Account Creation (Auto-generated Account Numbers).
2. Secure PIN authentication.
3. Real-time Balance updates.
